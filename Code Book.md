A group of 30 volunteers (subjects) performed six activities like WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING wearing a smartphone on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The purpose of this project is to collect and clean a data set so that the tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

VARIABLES in the tidy data are as follows:

"subjectId"
